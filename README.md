**Abstract**

This research project examines the impacts of Dubai's urban development over the last 30 years, as part of the course "Geographic Information Systems (GIS I) - Databases and Programming" from the Master's program in Geomatics. Environmental, socio-economic and climatic changes are analyzed using remote sensing data and Python codes that reflect the rapid growth and vast development of Dubai. In the framework of this analysis, vegetation changes are analyzed with the NDVI, soil changes with the NDBSI and the development of urban structures with the NDBI, the population growth and with the night time lights. In addition, the climatic changes in terms of land surface and average air temperature as well as the average precipitation between 1995 and 2024 are analyzed to ensure a comprehensive study. Furthermore, this examination also aims to highlight the importance of remote sensing analyses in the context of such changes.
